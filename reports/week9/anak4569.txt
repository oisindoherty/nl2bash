Individual Status Report - Week 8

  Copy of Last Week's Goals:
    - Finish the Thursday assignment.
    - (Moved to this week) try to help Hans get training done faster (+ mess around on my own).
      - Either with the UI data (+ old?) or by cleaning the old data of bad commands.
    - Finish travis integration (all components should be tested).
    - Host our version of Tellina and the TesterUI with the scraper working in the background on my cs site.
  
  What I've Done:
    - The Thursday assignment was completed (report updating and code review).
    - Researched options for hosting our site: we're going to just use attu as it seems the most reliable.
