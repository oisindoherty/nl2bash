Individual Status Report - Week 4

  Copy of Last Week's Goals:
    - Get the system ready for testing (both the UI and other components)
    - Finish addition to the report due on Thursday; work on feedback received for user manual
  
  What I've Done:
    - The build system has been created and travis is up and running! (Even on the vs submodule, but we might change that to html/js).
    - Our Thursday assignment was completed; we got a bunch of feedback on our report now (rather than our user manual), that we need to work on.
    - We decided to move to a html/js based implementation of the tester interface. This means we'll have to recreate the user manual section for it.
    
  Goals:
    - Finish the Thursday assignment
    - See if I can run the Tellina training module faster
    - Switch our user interface from vs solution/c# -> html/js; try to build it completely by next week
      - When this is done, the user manual must be updated
      - Get travis to work with whatever framework we choose to use; this might include writing tests
