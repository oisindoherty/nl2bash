Individual Status Report - Week 8

  Copy of Last Week's Goals:
    - Finish the Thursday assignment.
    - (Moved to this week) try to help Hans get training done faster (+ mess around on my own).
      - Either with the UI data (+ old?) or by cleaning the old data of bad commands.
    - Host our version of Tellina and the TesterUI with the scraper working in the background on my cs site.
  
  What I've Done:
    - The Thursday assignment was completed (final report first draft).
    - Besides this, I've mostly just read through the feedback from Victoria.
    
  Goals (copied from last week, mostly):
    - Attempt a full 100 epoch training (ours was 2/3) with at least 100 pairs.
    - Talk to Calvin/Michael and see what can be done this late (if we need to look at cleaning).
