Individual Status Report - Week 4

  Copy of Last Week's Goals:
    - Get Tellina setup and running; look at how it accepts datasets/updates its model
    - Create a prototype of the tester verification ui done
  
  What I've Done:
    - Finished the user manual. Got a bunch of feedback on how to improve it, including sections for common use cases and other things.
    - Created a repository for the Tester UI and have a 'local' prototype; need to get server logic and interactions down.
    
  Goals:
    - Get the system ready for testing (both the UI and other components)
    - Finish addition to the report due on Thursday; work on feedback received for user manual
