Week 6 Status Report

I neglected to write a status report for week 7, so these were my
established goals for week 6:
- Use the newly generated training model on the training interface (either through setting
  up the website or finding a command line interface).
- Add some data to the Tellina dataset (most likely through web scraping) and run the
  training algorithm again.
- Work with the staff to get AWS credits so that I can run more training sessions, perhaps
  on more powerful machines.

Over the last two weeks, I've kinda been in dire straits, honestly. I have managed to complete
a training run and gather initial table results, and have also just managed to get approval
from Amazon AWS to use a much more powerful instance that is 16 times more powerful than the
machine we were using. I have not managed, however, to run any training with additional data
or with the original training parameters (with 100 epochs), nor have I managed to test it with
the training interface (my previous attempt to reduce the time it would take to train the model
did not take well to the website application). In short, I have actually gotten very little work
done.

Over the next week, I will try to do more, including the following:
- Run the training with newly scraped data as it comes in.
- Publish this new model to the repository and run the website with it
- Get, if possible, access to Amazon credits through the university so that I don't have to pay
  for these training runs out of pocket.
