Individual Status Report - Week 8

  Copy of Last Week's Goals:
    - Finish the Thursday assignment.
    - (Moved to this week) try to help Hans get training done faster (+ mess around on my own).
      - Either with the UI data (+ old?) or by cleaning the old data of bad commands.
    - Finish travis integration (testing server in the script too).
  
  What I've Done:
    - The Thursday assignment was completed (initial results).
    - I got a lot of work done on the full pipeline script. Need to finish that and integrate it into travis.
    - Did research on how we can host our sites on a public domain (https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/web-publishing/shared-hosting/).
