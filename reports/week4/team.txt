Team Status Report: Week 4

Goals from Last Week:

Our next major task is completing the project architecture assignment. Aside 
from that, in the next week we will continue researching and designing the 
three project parts. We need to work on writing project specifications, and 
ensuring that each group member understands and agrees with those 
specifications. At that point, each team member will develop a prototype for 
their project part, which should be complete by next Wednesday.

Progress this Week:

(INSERT REST OF TEAM PROGRESS)
We have acquired a new team member, Hans, this week, and split off a fourth project
part for him to work on - the task of retraining the Tellina model with new data.
He has been able to get the Tensorflow training code running on his machine.

Goals for Next Week:
